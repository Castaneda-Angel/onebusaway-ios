# OBAKit

This library is a ground-up rewrite of the core modules of OneBusAway for iOS. It is designed to be stable, relatively bug-free, clear, and well-tested. It is designed to serve as the foundation of OneBusAway for iOS in its second decade of life.

## Quick Start

To get started, you will need the following pieces of software installed on your computer:

1. [Xcode 11.x](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) - Once installed, please launch Xcode and install any ancillary pieces of software it may prompt you to install.
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - A package manager used to install Xcodegen and Carthage.
3. [Xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) - This is used to generate the `xcodeproj` file used to build the project.
4. [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) - Manages third-party dependencies.
5. [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.


Once you have the five pieces of software installed, clone the OneBusAway app repository on github. (After this rewrite becomes the official version of the app, it will be in the OneBusAway github repository; for now ask Aaron for an invitation.)

    # Make sure you have Xcode 11.x and Homebrew installed.
    xcode-select --install
    brew install xcodegen
    brew install carthage
    brew install swiftlint
    # connect to the directory with the app code
    cd OBAKit
    carthage build --platform iOS
    xcodegen
    open OBAKit.xcodeproj

### Things Not Working Right?

If the `xcode-select --install` command results in an error message that the command line tools are already installed, you can verify that you have the latest version by typing the command `softwareupdate --list` to check whether any software should be updated; then if need be use `softwareupdate --install <project>` to  update it.

If the `carthage build --platform iOS` command gives an error claiming that it is unable to find utility "xcodebuild" because it is not a developer tool or in PATH, this should fix it:
`sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
Or see this github issue for other potential solutions: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/569

### Unit Tests Not Running?

After running XcodeGen and opening `OBAKit.xcodeproj`, select the "App" scheme. You should then be able to run the OneBusAway app by typing (Command+R) and run unit tests (Command+U). If either of these commands do not work, try recreating the OneBusAway scheme:

1. `Product` Menu > `Scheme` > `Manage Schemes`
2. Delete the `App` scheme (if it exists)
3. Click on the `Autocreate Schemes Now` button.
4. Click on the `Close` button.
5. Change the active scheme to `App`.

I'm sure there's a bug in the `project.yml` file that I have written that is causing this issue. Pull Requests to address this issue are welcome!

## Code and Structure

OBAKit is written almost entirely in Swift 5, with the exception of few small, ancillary pieces.

## Objective-C Compatibility

This project is designed to be usable within both Swift and Objective-C projects. Please open an issue for scenarios encountered where you are unable to effectively use the framework generated by this project in Objective-C code.

## Documentation

This project uses [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), which is written in Ruby, to generate its documentation. To install Jazzy, we recommend following these steps:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Once Jazzy is installed, you can generate the project's documentation by running the command

```bash
jazzy
```

### Documentation Bugs

Please log bugs with the label `Documentation` on any issues with the documentation, either because the documentation is missing or misleading.

## Functional Areas

### Protobuf

To make modifications to the local copy of `gtfs-realtime.proto`, you will need to install some new tools via the `brew` command:

```bash
brew install protobuf
brew install swift-protobuf
```

Now, `cd OBAKitCore/Models/Protobuf`, update `gtfs-realtime.proto` to the appropriate version, and run `./proto-gen.sh`.

### Networking

This framework consists of a Network Service layer and a Model Service layer, each of which have three service classes designed to work with the three data sources that OneBusAway for iOS depends on:

* Regions API
* REST API
* Obaco API (alerts.onebusaway.org or onebusaway.co)

This library would be suitable for using on its own in a custom application that would only need to communicate with a single, previously-defined OneBusAway server.

### Location

Region and location management helps to determine where the user is located in the world, and which OBA region, if any, they are currently located in.

### User Data Services

Management of bookmarks, recently-viewed stops, and other similar data. Basically, any data generated directly or indirectly by the user. This layer is designed around the `UserDataStore` protocol, which should lend itself to being used across multiple implementations. For now, the only implementation provided uses `NSUserDefaults`, but CloudKit or Firebase support, e.g., should be relatively easy to implement.

### Application

This is comprised of view controllers (e.g. `RecentStopsViewController`), controls (e.g. `BorderedButton`), theme support &amp; icons, and orchestration. 'Orchestration' is a catch-all name for the layer of the software that you, the developer, give a set of configuration data to, and are handed back a fully-configured `Application` object that represents a OneBusAway-style app. `Application` handles creating all of the services you'll need: REST, notifications, user data storage, and so forth.
