# OBAKit

OBAKit is a rewrite of OneBusAway for iOS from the ground up. The codebase is explicitly designed to be easy to understand, test, and maintain. This is the foundation of OneBusAway's second decade of life on Apple platforms.

## Quick Start

To get started, you will need the following pieces of software installed on your computer:

1. [Xcode 11.x](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) - Once installed, please launch Xcode and install any ancillary pieces of software about which it may prompt you.
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - A package manager used to install Xcodegen and Carthage.
3. [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) - This is used to generate the `xcodeproj` file used to build the project.
4. [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) - Manages third-party dependencies.
5. [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.
6. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) - _This should already be installed on your Mac_. A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.
7. [RVM](https://rvm.io) - _Optional, but very helpful_. RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple Ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

Once you have these pieces of software installed, clone the OneBusAway app repository on GitHub. (After this rewrite becomes the official version of the app, it will be in the OneBusAway GitHub repository; for now ask Aaron for an invitation.)

    # Make sure you have Xcode 11.x and Homebrew installed.
    xcode-select --install
    brew install xcodegen
    brew install carthage
    brew install swiftlint
    # open the directory with the app code
    cd OBAKit
    # note: depending on your system configuration, you may need to run this command with sudo, i.e. sudo gem install bundler
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    scripts/carthage_build
    scripts/generate_project OneBusAway
    open OBAKit.xcodeproj

## Project Files (.xcodeproj)

The directions above include a command `scripts/generate_project OneBusAway` to create the `xcodeproj` project file.  If you just want to build the OneBusAway app, that's all you need.  Here is some additional information in case you want to generate a different app.

OBAKit uses [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to create the `xcodeproj` file that makes Xcode function. XcodeGen takes a simple YAML file (`project.yml`) and turns it into a full-fledged `xcodeproj`. This makes it much easier to support white-labeling and managing multiple project targets.

Call `scripts/generate_project` from the project root directory with the name of a directory in `Apps`. So to generate the OneBusAway app, you run the command:

```bash
scripts/generate_project OneBusAway
```

Run `scripts/generate_project` on its own to see a list of available app targets.

## White Label Support

To create your own app target, duplicate the `Apps/OneBusAway` directory and update all of the available variables with the ones that are relevant to your project. [Learn more about White Label support by reading the documentation on the subject](Tutorials/WhiteLabel.md).

## Internationalization and Localization

_Note: There's a lot more to be written on this topic. Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is wrong or confusing._

We are using [Twine](https://github.com/scelis/twine) to manage localization. See the `Translations` folder for the three files that need to be updated in order to localize the app: `InfoPlist.txt`, `OBAKit.txt` and `OBAKitCore.txt`.

### How to Add a New Localizable String

If you need to add a new string to one of the frameworks, please do the following:

1. Use the function `OBALoc` instead of `NSLocalizedString`. Search the codebase for examples of the syntax and include a useful comment.
2. Run the script `scripts/extract_strings` from the Terminal. (note: it will respond with some warnings; these are normal and can be ignored.)
3. Clean up the new 'uncategorized' string table entries that have been added to the Twine localization files (make sure they get alphabetized, and the 'uncategorized' header is removed.)
4. Run the script `scripts/localize` to reduce the amount of churn in the Localizable.strings files, and to make sure temporary placeholder strings are generated for the languages supported by the app.
5. Open an issue documenting the need for new localized strings, including links to file lines that show which strings need to be translated.

### How to Translate a String in the App

Currently, the app is configured to work in English and Polish. To translate a string in a supported language that is currently not localized, for example, into Polish:

1. Open `Translations/OBAKitCore.txt` and `Translations/OBAKit.txt`.
2. Add translations for the strings on lines beginning with `pl = `
3. To test your changes, run the command `scripts/localize` from the command line and then launch the app (note: make sure the iOS Simulator is set to your desired language.)

Read on for how to add a new language or dialect.

### How to Add a New Language or Dialect

To translate the app into another language or dialect, you will first need to find the Language ID for your desired localization target. Start by reading through Apple's [documentation on Language IDs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LanguageandLocaleIDs/LanguageandLocaleIDs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i-CH15), and determine if you need to choose just a language designator, or a language designator plus a region designator.

For example, if you wanted to add Standard German to the app, you would specify the Language ID `de`, or to add Argentinian Spanish, you would specify the Language ID `es-AR`.

Once you know the Language ID that you will need to use, you must open the `Translations` directory in the root of the project. Each `.txt` file contained in there contains many string entries that need to be translated into your desired Language ID. For instance, here's the entry for the English verb "Close":

    [common.close]
        en = Close
        comment = The verb 'to close'.
        pl = Zamknij

To translate `common.close` into a new language, add a new line below `pl`:

    [common.close]
        en = Close
        comment = The verb 'to close'.
        pl = Zamknij
        de = Schlie√üen

To test your changes, run the command `scripts/localize` from the command line and then launch the app (note: make sure the iOS Simulator is set to your desired language.)

## Diagnosing Problems

### Command Line Errors?

If the `xcode-select --install` command results in an error message that the command line tools are already installed, you can verify that you have the latest version by typing the command `softwareupdate --list` to check whether any software should be updated; then if need be use `softwareupdate --install <project>` to  update it.

If the `carthage build --platform iOS` command gives an error claiming that it is unable to find utility "xcodebuild" because it is not a developer tool or in PATH, this should fix it:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

Or see this github issue for other potential solutions: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/569

### Swift Compiler Errors?

If you see errors that look like this when you compile:

```bash
error: module compiled with Swift 4.0 cannot be imported in Swift 4.0.3: /onebusaway/OBAKit/../Carthage/Build/iOS/PromiseKit.framework/Modules/PromiseKit.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftmodule
```

this is happening because the project's Carthage frameworks were compiled with an older version of the Swift compiler than the one you have on your computer. To fix, recompile the Carthage dependencies with this command from the command line:

```bash
carthage build --platform iOS --no-use-binaries
```

After Carthage finishes, we recommend cleaning your project and possibly deleting all of your build artifacts.

## Objective-C Compatibility

OBAKit is written almost entirely in Swift, with the exception of a few small, ancillary pieces of code. This project is designed to be usable within both Swift and Objective-C projects. Please open an issue for scenarios encountered where you are unable to effectively use the framework generated by this project in Objective-C code.

## Documentation

This project uses [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/) and [Sourcekitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) to generate its documentation. To rebuild documentation, you will first need to have both projects installed:

```bash
bundle install
brew install sourcekitten
```

Once you have the necessary tools installed, you can regenerate documentation by running the command:

```bash
scripts/docs
```

Configuration data for the Jazzy-generated documentation can be found in the file `.jazzy.json` in the root of the repository.

## Frameworks

The app is essentially a thin shell around two frameworks, `OBAKitCore` and `OBAKit`. `OBAKitCore` is responsible for networking, data models and storage, location services, and region management. `OBAKit` provides an iOS-compatible user interface that can easily be created from an app that consumes `OBAKit`.

## Functional Areas

### Protobuf

To make modifications to the local copy of `gtfs-realtime.proto`, you will need to install some new tools via the `brew` command:

```bash
brew install protobuf
brew install swift-protobuf
```

Now, replace the file `OBAKitCore/Models/Protobuf/gtfs-realtime.proto` with the updated version, and run `scripts/proto-gen.sh` from the project root.

You can find the latest version of the GTFS-RT protobuf file in the https://github.com/google/transit/ repository.
